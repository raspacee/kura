# Kura

Social site for free speech

## Why Kura?

- No algorithm. Posts are shown in order of their posted dates. No algorithm No content manipulation!
- No in-site image uploading feature(except profile pictures). In my opinion, allowing users to allow images degrade the quality of posts.
- Doesn't require email address(optional), phone number or driver's license to sign up.
